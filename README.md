## Meet Mago

Running a Magento store means living in the admin panel: digging through reports, hunting for
that one configuration setting, flushing the cache after every deploy. Mago puts a chat window
in your admin and does that work with you.

Type a question in plain language and Mago answers with **live data from your own store** —
revenue, best sellers, customers, configuration, content. Tell it to change something and it
**does it for you**, but only after you've confirmed. It streams its answer as it works, shows
numbers as stat cards, charts and tables where that helps, and never touches anything your
admin role doesn't allow.

</p>

### Why merchants like it

- **Free, forever.** Mago is open source under the MIT licence — no licence fee, no seats, no subscription. You only pay your AI provider for what you use, and Mago keeps its prompts small so a typical action costs a few cents.
- **Your AI, your key.** Bring your own Anthropic or OpenAI key (or Gemini, Azure, DeepSeek, Ollama and more). Requests go straight from your store to your provider — there is no Mago server in between.
- **Nothing changes without your OK.** Reading is instant; every write asks first. Irreversible actions such as cancelling an order or issuing a refund show their impact before you confirm.
- **Follows your admin roles.** Read and write access run through Magento's own ACL, so every admin sees exactly what their role allows.
- **Answers you can act on.** Stat cards, charts, tables and record lists, plus deep links straight into the admin page you need.
- **Grows with the community.** Agencies and module vendors add new skills as addons, without touching core.

### What you can ask

| Ask a question… | …or give an instruction |
|---|---|
| "What were our best sellers this week?" | "Set the free shipping threshold to €75" |
| "How did revenue compare to last month?" | "Flush the cache" (`/cache flush` works too) |
| "Which customers ordered more than three times?" | "Reindex the catalog" |
| "Where do I change the tax display setting?" | "Write a product description for SKU LT-2201" |
| "Which products have no image?" | "Disable the Christmas CMS block" |
| "How do I set up a cart price rule?" *(answered from the official docs)* | "Cancel order #100004521" *(shows impact, asks to confirm)* |

See [docs/skills-examples.md](docs/skills-examples.md) for more example prompts per skill.

## Features

- **Natural language chat** in the Magento admin panel
- **Real-time streaming** responses via SSE
- **Built-in skills** for sales analytics, store configuration, content management, and admin navigation
- **Slash commands** — `/cache flush`, `/cache clean <type>`, `/index status`, `/index reindex` run directly against Magento, no AI round-trip
- **Extensible architecture** — third-party modules can register custom skills via DI
- **ACL-based permissions** — read/write access controlled per admin role
- **Write confirmation** — every write asks first; irreversible actions (cancel, refund, delete) show their impact and need an explicit acknowledgement, several writes in one turn become a tick list
- **Answer widgets** — stat cards, charts, tables and record lists in the answer where the data allows it (see [docs/ui-components.md](docs/ui-components.md))
- **Write confirmation** — destructive actions always require explicit user approval
- **Form access** — reads and stages field changes on the admin form open in the browser
  (including unsaved edits), but never saves: changes are only staged into the form's own fields,
  same as typing them in, and the administrator's own Save click is what persists anything
- **Multi-provider** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Ollama and LM Studio, through [MageOS_AiBase](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-ai-base)
- **Documentation grounding** — answers admin how-to questions from Magento/Adobe Commerce docs, fetched into your database (optional)

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2
- Magento >= 2.4.9 or Mage-OS >= 3.0 (Symfony 7.3+ required by the AI bridges)
- An API key for one of the supported providers

## Installation

Anthropic and OpenAI are included out of the box. For other providers (Azure, Gemini, DeepSeek,
Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) install the matching Symfony AI bridge — see `composer.json` suggests.

```bash
composer require mago-assistant/mago
bin/magento module:enable MageOS_AiBase MagoAssistant_Mago
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Configuration

First add a provider under `Stores > Configuration > Mage-OS > AI Configuration`: pick the
backend, paste the API key, choose a model, and use **Test Connection** to check it answers.

Then, under `Stores > Configuration > Mago Assistant`:

1. **Enable** the module (General)
2. **Pick the AI Service** the assistant runs on (API Settings). Leave it on *Automatic* to use
   the first usable one, which is what a single-provider store wants.

### Internal API URL (Docker / reverse proxy setups)

If the module's internal REST API calls fail (e.g. in Docker environments where PHP can't reach itself via the public hostname), configure `Stores > Configuration > Mago Assistant > API Settings > Internal API URL`.

Examples:
- markshust/docker-magento: `https://app:8443`
- DDEV: `https://ddev-<project>-web:443`
- Leave empty to use the store's base URL (works for most setups)

These calls verify the TLS certificate by default. If the internal URL points at a host whose certificate cannot match (loopback addresses, container hostnames, self-signed certificates), set `Verify TLS Certificate` to No. Keep it enabled in production.

## Built-in Skills

| Skill area | Tools | Access |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Store Analytics | `sales_data`, `product_data`, `customer_data` | Read |
| Store Configuration | `config_reader`, `config_writer`, `cache_manager`, `indexer_manager` | Read / Write |
| Content Management | `cms_data`, `content_generator` | Read / Write |
| Navigation | `admin_navigator` | Read |
| Documentation | `docs_search` | Read |
| Form Access | `page_form` | Read / Stage (never saves) |
| Hosting | `hypernode_status` | Read / Write (annotations) |

See [docs/skills-examples.md](docs/skills-examples.md) for example prompts per skill and [docs/skills-roadmap.md](docs/skills-roadmap.md) for the full roadmap of planned skills.

### Slash commands

Typing `/` in the chat shows the available commands. These run without the AI provider and reply instantly:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/cache flush` | Flush all caches |
| `/cache clean <type> [type...]` | Clean specific cache types |
| `/cache status` | List cache types and their status |
| `/index list` | List all indexers |
| `/index status` | Show indexer status |
| `/index reindex [indexer_id...]` | Reindex all indexers, or only the given IDs |
| `/help` | List the commands you may use |

Write commands need the `MagoAssistant_Mago::assistant_write` ACL resource plus a write grant on the underlying skill. See [docs/skills-architecture.md](docs/skills-architecture.md#slash-commands) for registering your own commands.

The answer widgets and skill cards the chat panel renders are documented in [docs/ui-components.md](docs/ui-components.md); [docs/ui-components-examples.md](docs/ui-components-examples.md) shows every component with sample data and the call behind it.
`page_form` reads the admin form currently open in the browser and can stage new field values for
the administrator to confirm — it never writes to the database itself, only into the same fields
the administrator would type into, so their own Save button is what persists anything. See
[docs/form-access.md](docs/form-access.md) for what it can see, which forms are excluded, and the
directive contract it uses to reach the browser.

## Hypernode server performance

The `hypernode_status` skill answers "is the server slow?" questions with live data from the Hypernode
the store runs on: load, memory and disk (`server_overview`), busy PHP-FPM workers (`php_workers`), request
rate, status codes, 5xx errors, cache handlers and PHP response times from the nginx JSON access log
(`http_traffic`, read from `/var/log/nginx/access.log`), recent node tasks (`recent_flows`) and custom
[Hypernode Insights](https://insights.hypernode.com) annotations (`list_annotations`,
`create_annotation`, the only write action). Every action, including the local server metrics, requires a
configured API, and the live load, CPU, memory and disk block is only reported when PHP runs on the Hypernode
itself: elsewhere those `/proc` values describe the machine running Docker, not the node. Client addresses, users and query strings never leave the
server; the token is never sent to the AI provider. Use of the skill requires the `Magento_Backend::system` ACL.

On a Hypernode nothing needs configuring: the app name comes from the hostname and the API token from
`/etc/hypernode/hypernode_api_token`. Off-node (staging, local Docker) fill in both under
`Stores > Configuration > Mago Assistant > Hypernode`; the API actions then work, the on-node ones report
that they are not available off the node.

| Field | Config path | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| App name | `mago/hypernode/app_name` | detected from hostname | The Hypernode app, e.g. `yourshop` for yourshop.hypernode.io |
| API token | `mago/hypernode/api_token` | read from the node | Encrypted; from `/etc/hypernode/hypernode_api_token` |

## Documentation grounding

When enabled, the assistant can answer "how do I…" questions from the official Magento admin documentation instead of guessing. The `docs_search` skill runs a MySQL FULLTEXT search over an indexed copy of the docs and cites the source page it used.

### Configuration

`Stores > Configuration > Mago Assistant > Documentation`

| Field | Config path | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enable documentation grounding | `mago/docs/enabled` | `0` | Master switch; also gates the sync cron |
| Source repository | `mago/docs/source_repo` | `mage-os/mirror-commerce-admin.en` | GitHub `owner/repo` to index. Default is the MIT-licensed Mage-OS mirror of Adobe's Commerce Admin docs |
| Source branch / commit | `mago/docs/ref` | `main` | Branch or commit to index; pin to a commit for reproducibility |
| Results per search | `mago/docs/top_k` | `5` | Max doc pages returned per search |
| Sync schedule | `mago/docs/cron_expr` | `0 4 1 * *` (monthly) | Cron expression for the re-index job |

### How the corpus is built

A cron job (`mago_docs` group, its own process) indexes the docs into the `mago_doc` table (~5 MB). To index immediately instead of waiting for the cron:

```bash
bin/magento mago:docs:index --force
```

Sync is cheap to run often because it is **change-detected by git tree SHA**: an unchanged source repo costs a single API call and skips re-fetching entirely. This is why the default schedule can safely be raised when you feed docs that update more often than the Mage-OS mirror. On a real change, every `help/**.md` is fetched (including `_includes/`, needed to resolve `{{$include}}` partials), Experience League markup is normalized to plain text, and the table is swapped in a single transaction — a failed sync keeps the previous corpus, and searches keep answering from the old corpus until the new one is committed. Only one sync runs at a time: a second invocation (cron overlapping a manual run, or a double-started command) reports `another sync is already running` and exits instead of interfering.

### Why MySQL FULLTEXT (not embeddings)

Retrieval uses a MySQL FULLTEXT index rather than vector embeddings so the feature works on any Magento install with **zero extra infrastructure** — no vector database, no embeddings service, and no dependency on a specific AI provider (Anthropic, for one, has no embeddings API). For a bounded, well-structured doc corpus this keyword search is accurate enough, and the assistant compensates for the lack of semantic matching by issuing multiple searches with different terms when the first result set is thin. Semantic/vector retrieval can be added later as an optional backend without changing the skill contract.

### Custom docs

The pipeline is source-repo agnostic: point `Source repository` at any public GitHub repo of Adobe Experience League-flavored (or plain) markdown to ground the assistant on your own documentation. Private repos and non-GitHub sources are on the roadmap.

## Extending with Custom Skills

Third-party modules can register tools by implementing `ToolInterface` and adding them to the `ToolRegistry` via `di.xml`. No core modifications needed.

See [docs/skills-architecture.md](docs/skills-architecture.md) for the full architecture reference, including:

- How the skill/tool system works
- Step-by-step guide for building custom skills
- ACL and permissions model
- Data & privacy details
- MCP compatibility roadmap

## Testing

End-to-end tests run with Playwright against Chromium. No test calls a real provider: the
chat panel is covered with browser-level SSE stubs, the backend with WireMock standing in for
the provider endpoint.

```bash
cd Test/End-2-end
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
BASE_URL="https://your-store.test/" npx playwright test
```

See [Test/End-2-end/README.md](Test/End-2-end/README.md) for configuration, the WireMock setup
and how to add scenarios.

## Permissions

| ACL Resource | Grants |
|---|---|
| `MagoAssistant_Mago::config` | Module configuration access |
| `MagoAssistant_Mago::assistant_read` | Read-only tools (analytics, config reading, navigation) |
| `MagoAssistant_Mago::assistant_write` | Write tools (config changes, CMS, content generation) |

## Data & privacy

Mago stores nothing outside your Magento installation. Every request goes directly from your
store to the AI provider you configured, using your own API key; what that provider does with
the request is governed by its API terms. Mago only reads what the current admin's role allows
and never writes without an explicit confirmation. Details in
[docs/skills-architecture.md](docs/skills-architecture.md#data--privacy).

## Community

Mago is built in the open with developers, community builders and backers from the Dutch
Magento ecosystem. Issues and pull requests are welcome at
