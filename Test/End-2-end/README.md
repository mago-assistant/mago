# End-2-end tests

Playwright tests for the admin chat panel (`view/adminhtml/web/js/chat-panel.js`).
Layout and configuration follow [mollie/magento2](https://github.com/mollie/magento2/tree/master/Test/End-2-end).

## How the AI is kept out of the loop

The browser never talks to an AI provider. It reads an SSE stream of
`text` / `tool_call` / `confirm` / `done` / `error` events from `mago/chat/stream`.
`ChatMock` intercepts that endpoint and replays the fixtures in `fixtures/scenarios.ts`,
so every run is deterministic, free and offline. No API key is needed and no test ever
calls a model.

## Configuration

Everything is read from environment variables, no config file to edit:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | `https://mago.test/` | Magento base URL, with trailing slash |
| `ADMIN_PATH` | `admin` | `backend/frontName` from `app/etc/env.php` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `exampleuser` | Admin username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `examplepassword123` | Admin password |
| `WIREMOCK_ADMIN_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | WireMock admin API, for request-journal assertions |
| `MAGO_DEBUG_LOG` | `/var/www/html/var/log/mago-debug.log` | Path of the Mago debug log as seen from the test runner |

```bash
BASE_URL="https://your-store.test/" npx playwright test
```

To keep values in a file instead, uncomment the dotenv lines at the top of
`playwright.config.ts` and add a `.env`.

## Prerequisites

The module has to be switched on, otherwise the panel is not rendered at all:

```bash
bin/magento config:set mago/general/enabled 1
bin/magento cache:flush
```

An AI service has to be configured too, or the panel answers every question with an error. The
backend tests set one up below; for the browser-level tests any row will do, since they never
reach a provider.

On a freshly installed store, two dashboard modals cover the screen on first login and swallow
every click: Magento's admin usage tracking modal and the release notification banner. Either
answer both once by hand or disable the modules:

```bash
bin/magento module:disable Magento_AdminAnalytics Magento_ReleaseNotification
bin/magento cache:flush
```

`ddev mago-e2e` disables `Magento_ReleaseNotification` for you before every run, if it is
enabled, and reports what it did. `Magento_AdminAnalytics` depends on it, so the script disables
that one too when it is still enabled, since Magento refuses to disable a module something else
still depends on. The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/end-2-end.yml`) disables both on every run.

The `setup` project logs in once and stores the session in `.auth/backend.json`,
which every other test reuses. It fails with an explicit message if the panel is missing.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

BASE_URL="https://your-store.test/" npx playwright test
npx playwright test --headed    # watch it happen
npx playwright test --ui        # Playwright UI mode
```

Reports: `npx playwright show-report`.

The backend tests need an AI service pointed at WireMock instead of a real provider. The row uses
the LM Studio bridge, whose base URL is a local-runtime address by design, so nothing has to be
redirected and no credential is involved:

```bash
docker run -d --name wiremock -p 8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)/wiremock:/home/wiremock:ro" wiremock/wiremock:3.13.1
bin/magento config:set mageos_ai/services/configuration \
  '{"_e2e_row_1":{"lmstudio":{"base_url":"http://wiremock:8080","model":"gemma-3-4b-it-qat"}}}'
bin/magento cache:flush config
```

**This overwrites every AI service already configured on the install, and stored API keys cannot
be read back once gone.** Point it at a throwaway store, or save the row first:

```bash
bin/magento config:show mageos_ai/services/configuration
```

The base URL stops at the host: the bridge appends `/v1/chat/completions` itself. The hostname has
to resolve from inside the container running Magento, so put WireMock on the same network. See
`.github/workflows/templates/docker-compose.yml` for a working example. The bridge itself comes
from `symfony/ai-lm-studio-platform`, which is a `suggest` of `MageOS_AiBase` and so has to be
installed explicitly.

The fixtures are OpenAI chat-completions SSE, which is what LM Studio speaks. The model has to be
one the bridge's own catalogue lists, because a bridge refuses to route anything else before a
request is ever sent; `gemma-3-4b-it-qat` ships with `symfony/ai-lm-studio-platform` and declares
tool calling and streaming, which is all these tests need of it.

**This provider row is a prerequisite, not something the runner sets up for you.** If this
repository is run through `ddev mago-e2e`, that command only checks whether
`mageos_ai/services/configuration` exists and prints a warning if it doesn't — it does not
configure the row above. Every spec that exercises the real backend (anything that talks to
WireMock rather than `ChatMock`) fails at the network level until the `config:set` above has been
run once against the install.

## Browsers

Chromium only (`devices['Desktop Chrome']`). Firefox, WebKit and the mobile
viewports are present but commented out in `playwright.config.ts`, same as Mollie.

## Layout

```
global-setup.ts                     runs once, before the setup project
tsconfig.json                       Pages/ Actions/ Services/ Config/ Fixtures/ path aliases
fixtures/scenarios.ts               canned SSE conversations, one per scenario
support/pages/backend/BackendLogin  admin login
support/pages/backend/ChatPanel     locators and interactions for the chat panel
support/actions/backend/ChatMock    SSE builder and route interception
support/config/timeouts             PROVIDER_ROUND_TRIP_TIMEOUT, shared by every real-backend spec
tests/auth/backend-auth.setup.ts    writes .auth/backend.json
tests/*.spec.ts                     the tests
```

## Adding a scenario

Add an entry to `fixtures/scenarios.ts` describing the events the backend would emit,
then drive it with `chatMock.install(page, scenario)`. A write action needs a `confirm`
event plus a `status` payload, because the frontend resolves the message id through
`mago/chat/status` when it only has a conversation id.

For a backend scenario (real controller and tools, only the provider mocked) add a mapping file
under `wiremock/mappings/` and its SSE bodies under `wiremock/__files/`. Key each scenario on a
unique phrase in the user's question so mappings never collide, and give every turn a fallback
mapping with a lower priority that answers with a clearly wrong sentence: a test that reads
"Store scope missing" in the reply fails for the right reason instead of timing out.
`tests/store-scope.spec.ts` shows the pattern.

## Operational rules learned the hard way

These aren't visible from reading a single spec file, and getting one wrong costs real debugging
time — so they're collected here instead.

**Delete a runtime-registered WireMock stub in `afterEach`, always.** A spec that registers its own
mapping via `POST /__admin/mappings` (rather than relying on the checked-in files under
`wiremock/mappings/`) has to delete it again in `afterEach` (`DELETE /__admin/mappings/<id>`, see
`write-fields-action.spec.ts`). WireMock keeps every mapping across the whole worker's lifetime
otherwise; a stub left behind by one test can still be present, and can still win a match, in a
later test — this run or a later one — which makes stub selection arbitrary and the assertions
against it meaningless without ever failing loudly. The checked-in, file-based mappings are the
baseline every runtime stub is registered on top of and deleted back down to: `POST
/__admin/mappings/reset` restores exactly **28** mappings (`cms-page.json`: 2,
`deny-customer-facing-forms.json`: 3, `navigation-note.json`: 1, `page-context.json`: 3,
`page-form.json`: 14, `store-scope.json`: 5 — the `page_form` specs account for 18 of them).

**Never assert on a Magento admin flash message.** Flash messages are session-stored and consumed
by the very first render that reads them; every spec in this suite shares one admin session via
`.auth/backend.json`, so a flash message a different, concurrently-running spec happened to render
first is simply gone by the time yours checks for it — not delayed, gone. Wait on the actual round
trip instead (the assistant's own reply text, or a value read back through the REST/admin API) and
assert against that, the way `backend-integration.spec.ts` waits for the CMS page to actually exist
via `MagentoApi` rather than for a "You saved the page" banner.

**Playwright's 5s default assertion timeout is too short for a turn that hits a real backend.** A
real turn is Magento bootstrap, tool execution, a WireMock call and an SSE round trip, competing
with whatever the suite's other parallel workers are doing on the same PHP-FPM pool, MySQL instance
and WireMock container — regularly enough to blow past 5s under normal load, not just when
something is actually hung. `test.setTimeout()` raises the whole test's ceiling but does **not**
raise any individual `expect(...)` call's own timeout, so it does not fix this on its own; pass
`{timeout: PROVIDER_ROUND_TRIP_TIMEOUT}` (20000, see any real-backend spec) to every assertion that
waits on a streamed reply.

**Local workers are pinned to 3**, not Playwright's own default of half the available cores — see
the comment on `workers` in `playwright.config.ts` for the reasoning (every worker drives a full
admin page load against one shared PHP-FPM pool and MySQL instance, so the server, not the browser,
is the bottleneck; a higher worker count was measured to cost the same wall-clock time while
starving trivial specs into their own timeouts).

## Known gaps

These tests stop at the SSE boundary. Nothing here covers `ChatService`, tool
execution, ACL checks or database writes, and nothing detects the model no longer
picking the right tool after a prompt or schema change.

There is no product-creation tool. `product_data` exposes `search`, `get_by_sku`,
`count` and `low_stock`, all read-only, so "create a product" cannot succeed.
`catalog-questions.spec.ts` pins the assistant to declining rather than reporting a
success that never happened. Delete that test once a write tool lands.

`route.fulfill` delivers the whole response body at once, so these tests do not
exercise chunk-boundary buffering in the SSE reader. Covering that needs a server
that streams in deliberately awkward slices.
