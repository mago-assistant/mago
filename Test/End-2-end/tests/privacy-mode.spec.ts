 * travels through the real controller, ChatService, tool execution and the privacy filter, and only
 * the provider is played by WireMock. The panel assertions prove the turn completed; the journal
 * assertions read what actually crossed the wire to the provider, so a regression that leaks the
 * canary cannot hide behind a working chat panel. A catch-all mapping
 * (wiremock/mappings/privacy-canary-tripwire.json) additionally answers HTTP 500 "PRIVACY LEAK"
 * to any unmatched provider request carrying the canary email, so a leak in any other spec of the
 * suite fails loudly too.
