Write the prompt in English, even when the admin writes in another language. Describe what should change
(scene, background, lighting, motion, camera) and keep the product itself as in its main image; do not ask
Higgsfield to alter the product's shape, colour, text or logo unless the admin asks for it.
Every generation costs credits, so start one generation per request of the admin and never retry a failed
one on your own.
