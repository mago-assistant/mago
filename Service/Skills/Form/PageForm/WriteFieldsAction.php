/**
 * Stages one or more field changes on the admin form currently open in the browser and hands the
 * browser a form_write directive (the client_directive channel from task 005) so it can apply them
 * once the administrator confirms. This action never saves, persists or reloads anything itself: it
 * only validates the requested changes against the snapshot of the open form and describes them.
 * Saving remains the administrator's own action, through the form's normal Save button.
 *
 * isReadOnly() is false, so AbstractSkill routes every call through the confirmation flow before
 * execute() ever runs; the moment it runs is the moment the administrator has already agreed.
 *
 * form_namespace, entity_id and store_id are required parameters rather than values this action
 * derives itself, because on the confirm request the page context holder holds whatever the browser
 * resent for the page the administrator is on right now, which is not necessarily the page the model
 * had in mind when it proposed the write. Requiring the model to copy them from a prior describe_form
 * call, and refusing when they no longer match, is what catches a navigation between proposal and
 * confirmation instead of silently writing to the wrong page.
 *
 * When no form is open at all, an entity_type naming a known, navigable entity (see EntityRouteMap)
 * turns this into navigate-then-act (task 009) instead of a plain refusal: the browser is handed a
 * form_navigate directive carrying the entity's own admin URL (built through SecureAdminUrl, so the
 * admin secret key is respected) and the raw changes, and stages them itself once it has navigated
 * there and the target form has loaded. The changes cannot be validated against a snapshot here,
 * because no form describing that entity is open yet; the browser re-validates the target the same
 * way it does for an ordinary form_write directive (task 008's guard) once it arrives.
 *
 * The same navigate-then-act path also covers two more cases. An empty entity_id with a known,
 * creatable entity_type means "create one": the browser is sent to that entity's own New form
 * (NewEntityUrlBuilder) and stages the values there, so "add a product to this category" works
 * from the category form instead of ending in a list of manual steps. And a form being open does
 * not pin the assistant to it: an entity_type naming a different entity (or a different id of the
 * same type) than the form on screen navigates there too, rather than refusing as a stale target.
 * The stale-target refusal (findTargetMismatch) is kept for a call that names no entity_type at
 * all, since that is the shape of a write the model proposed against a form that has since changed.
 *
 * FormPolicy is checked against that same navigation target, before a directive is ever built, so
 * navigate-then-act cannot send the administrator's browser to a form the feature excludes wholesale
 * (customer, order, admin user, ...) just because no form happened to be open yet to deny. Denying
 * only once a form_write directive's target no longer matches an open, already-denied form would
 * leave this path uncovered entirely, since there is no open form here to check in the first place.
